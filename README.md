Amethyst Nether is a datapack and mod that transforms the Nether by giving it a new appearance, adding biomes, structures, mobs, items, recipes, advancements, and more.

## 📝 Description
The project was released in December 2022. It was created by amethyst137 and continued by bbschef, who is currently in charge. It is recommended to use Amethyst Nether in new worlds, and it **cannot be removed once applied without a reset** (reading the wiki is recommended to learn how to apply it correctly).

## ✨ Features
World generation uses custom noise values and density functions to modify the terrain, giving it a more cavernous appearance. It includes rivers, caves, canyons, and more. For more information, visit the Modrinth [Wiki](https://modrinth.com/datapack/amethyst-nether).

## 📌 Notes
- Not compatible with datapacks or mods that change Nether world generation, such as Incendium, Amplified Nether, BetterNether, or Biomes O' Plenty.
- Compatible with datapacks or mods that add Nether structures, such as Dungeon and Taverns or Uncovery.
- Still in development; new content will be added in future versions. For updates, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rkzQXctkXj).
